### Description
Every good developer knows that being able to troubleshoot their code effectively is crucial to being productive. In this course, Creating and Debugging R Programs, you'll gain an understanding of how independently running scripts works within the R platform and how to quickly debug them in the case the need arises. First, you’ll explore the various data types that R provides and learn how to leverage them when processing data. Once you have those understood, you’ll learn how variables are leveraged within functions and how they’re encapsulated within a function’s environment. Finally, you'll discover how to write a non-interactive R script and schedule it to run on multiple platforms. When you’re finished with this course, you’ll have the skills and knowledge to successfully write and run your own independent scripts and troubleshoot running them in a production environment.
