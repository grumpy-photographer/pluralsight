### Description
Context is important when approaching a language that's been around as long as C. The syntax may look familiar because it has inspired the creation of so many other languages over the years, but its unique capabilities and the problems it solves are quite different from those derivative languages. In this course, C Language: The Big Picture, you'll learn the history of the language, the problems it solves, and why you should consider learning it. First, you'll explore why C was created, how it has evolved and why it remains relevant. Next, you'll discover use cases for this powerful language and why it is often a better choice than many more modern options. Finally, you'll get a quick introduction to the structure of a C program and the tools you need to begin writing and running your own C code. When you're finished with this course, you'll have the skills and knowledge needed to decide if C is the right language for your project, dive deeper into the syntax of the language, and begin writing your first programs.
