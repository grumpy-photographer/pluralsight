### Description

Providing crisp, clear, actionable points-of-view to senior executives is becoming an increasingly important role of data scientists and data professionals these days. In this course, Communicating Data Insights you will gain the ability to summarize complex information into such clear and actionable insights. First, you will learn how to sum up the important descriptive statistics from any numeric dataset. Next, you will discover how to build and use specialized visual representations such as candlestick charts, Sankey diagrams and funnel charts in Python. You will then see how the data behind such representations can now be fed in from enterprise-wide sources such as data warehouses and ETL pipelines. Finally, you will round out the course by working with data residing in different public cloud platforms, and even in a hybrid environment, that is with some of it on-premise and some of it on the cloud. When youâ€™re finished with this course, you will have the skills and knowledge to pull together data from disparate sources and use nifty visualizations to convey crisp, actionable points-of-view to a senior executive audience.
