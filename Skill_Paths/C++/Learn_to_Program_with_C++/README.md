### Description
This course is aimed at those who have never programmed before. If you're interested in programming and have a reason for choosing C++ as a language to learn, this course is for you. Rather than learning programming concepts in a language you donâ€™t care about and then learning C++, you can do both at once. In this course, Learn to Program with C++, you'll learn basic programming concepts along with C++ syntax. First, you'll learn how to get the tools to develop in C++ and basics like building and running an application. Next, you'll expand your knowledge of C++ syntax and concepts. Finally, you'll discover how to use classes from the C++ Standard Library and how to write and use your own functions and classes. When you've complete this course, you'll know enough C++ to get started, as well as many of the things that make C++ unlike other languages, and you'll be ready to learn libraries and frameworks specific to the kinds of applications you want to make.
