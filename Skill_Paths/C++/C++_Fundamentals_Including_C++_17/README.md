### Description
C++ is a general purpose programming language that is used by millions of developers. It has a reputation for being hard to learn and use, but with the changes in the language over the last few decades, this reputation is no longer deserved. C++ offers a powerful combination of performance and abstraction that other languages don’t have. In this course, C++ Fundamentals Including C++ 17, you'll learn how to write simple console applications and be ready to move on to writing platform-specific code. First, you’ll learn the basics of language syntax: declaring variables, classes, building expressions using operators and functions, working up to templates, indirection, and polymorphism. You'll explore the syntax additions from C++ 11, C++ 14, and C++17, using any modern compiler to run the examples. You'll also see the principles of Modern C++ in action, relying on the Standard Library and using idioms like Resource Acquisition is Initialization to reduce the effort involved in memory management. By the end of this course, you’ll be comfortable reading and writing Modern C++, including features added in C++17.
